  <h1>Access Path Update — Q4 Maintenance Window</h1>
  <p>During the scheduled Q4 maintenance window, teams performing elevation-related tasks may need to switch temporarily into the designated profile before continuing. Please confirm the active profile prior to initiating any handover steps.</p>
  <p>All adjustments made in this period are confined to the maintenance window and are fully audited for compliance. If anything appears out of alignment, contact internal-support@example.com so the operations desk can review the session log.</p>
