  <title>04 — Retention & Key Rotation</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Retention & Key Rotation — Operational Notes</h1>
  <p>Archived objects may retain prior revisions for auditing purposes, and teams should expect legacy snapshots to remain accessible until oversight confirms their disposition.</p>
  <p>The current rotation cycle is underway, with policy language under review to ensure each handoff is recorded before the next credential set becomes active.</p>
  <h2>Recent changes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Oct 05, 2025: Added interim retention checkpoints for archived bundles.</li>
    <li>Oct 10, 2025: Initiated staged replacement of encryption keys across secondary environments.</li>
    <li>Oct 13, 2025: Draft policy amendments circulated to compliance for final approval.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Reminders</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Verify that retention requests include the intended review period before submission.</li>
    <li>Document each handoff during rotation to maintain traceability of active keys.</li>
    <li>Escalate any unexpected access anomalies to the operations queue without delay.</li>
  </ul>
